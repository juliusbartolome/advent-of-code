# Advent of Code Personal Challenge

Hello there! This is your personal repository for the Advent of Code challenge. Advent of Code is an annual event where every day from December 1st to 25th, a new coding challenge is released. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and learn new concepts.

## What's Inside?

This repository will contain:

1. **Daily Challenges**: Each day, a new folder will be created with the day's challenge. Inside, you'll find a README with the problem statement and any necessary files to solve the problem.

2. **Solutions**: After you've given the problem a shot, you can check the solution file to see a possible way to solve the problem. Remember, there's no single correct solution in programming!

3. **Progress Tracker**: Keep track of your progress and see how far you've come. It's not a race, so don't worry if you miss a day or two.

## Why Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a fantastic way to improve your coding skills. It exposes you to a variety of problem types, helping you become a more versatile programmer. Plus, it's a lot of fun!

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Pull the Latest Changes**: Each day, pull the latest changes to get the day's challenge.

2. **Read the Problem Statement**: Carefully read the problem statement in the README. Make sure you understand the problem before you start coding.

3. **Code**: Solve the problem in the language of your choice. Don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try. It's all about learning and improving!

4. **Check the Solution**: After you've solved the problem (or if you're stuck), check the solution file. Try to understand the solution, even if it's different from your own.

5. **Reflect**: Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned. What did you do well? What could you improve? What new things did you learn?

Remember, the goal is not to finish first, but to learn and improve. Happy coding!
